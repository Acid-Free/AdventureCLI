-Create a CLI to allow you to play a game
-There needs to be a grid which will be our "Map" of any size
-The player's goal is to reach the top right, starting at the bottom left
-The player can move up, down, left or right (but not off the map)
- Each move there's a small chance for either an Enemy or an Item to spawn at that spot
- If an Item, the stats get added automatically to the Player permanently along with some text to show what it is
- If an Enemy, the Player will "fight" the Enemy until one of them runs out of HP. The player permanently loses any HP lost during the fight. Damage = Attack - Defense
- The player wins the game if they reach the "goal" in the top right and loses if they los all their HP befor reaching the goal
-Moving makes the tile discovered
-No enemies and items spawn in discovered tiles
